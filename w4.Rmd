```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
The given question consist of varables like aoole and boll

Because of the given curcumstences the output can be given by taking the individual inputs

If the instance is aa bb cc then this case would be cc bb aa

By taking the given values we can predict the final values

In the current situation we can get negative as well as positive values

the given range can be from tn to twenty both values

What if the crosstalk is used instead of crayon function

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
crayon,crosstalk,curl can be used any time

glue cannot be used everytime
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
